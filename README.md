# Open source 


## Our purpose

_Our purpose is to improve society by considering social outcomes in everything we do, relentlessly focusing on excellence and digital innovation, transforming our clients’ businesses, our communities and employee opportunities._

## Open source 

Two major items on which we can contribute to open-source projects is to:
* Lead, implement and release open-source projects
* Contribute to existing OS projects.

### A way to give back

* Sharing knowledge under an open source license is a way to give back to the commons and to improve social outcomes.
* It also aligns with _relentlessly focusing on excellence and digital innovation_ as it unlocks opportunities of open-source information, tools and knowledge sourcing in an often-digital realm.

## A way to increase visibility 

* Open-source software plays a central role in our day-to-day life. By contributing back to open-source projects, we demonstrate our willingness to contribute and increase our visibility.
* This visibility plays in favor of both the individual and their employer.

* It also gives _projects_ visibility, internally and externally, giving the developer team more chances to connect with users and other teams.

## A way to develop expertise

* By starting small, on ad-hoc contribution on projects, one can develop their skills and confidence.

## A foundation for tools

* Open-source packages are often used to build software. By being part of the software fabric, we ensure continuity and maintainability of what we do, even if we stop maintaining the project as well.

# OS as a liability

## Being clear on what OS is

* People can think that, because a project is OS, all (including 24/7 support) is due.

## Sometimes.. OS is an obligation

* By using previous open source software, we can have to release derivatives under a similar license: OS can contaminate « downstream » pieces of work

## Maintaining projects

* Open-source project can have a community of users and developers. As such, the role of the maintainer is crucial and can often make a huge difference of the life of the project. 
* Moreover, maintaining a project requires a specific set of skills that not everyone has developped.

## Image

* Publicly released artefacts do reflect the quality of work of an organization an individual belongs to. Poorly coded/documented artefacts can be seen as a lack of professionalism from this organization. 

## Security

* One has to be aware of the leaks (information, credentials, ...) that can come with pushing public digital artefacts.

## IP

* All information being published needs to be checked and approved as being appropriate for public release. Publication of unwanted IP can lead to serious legal issues.
* Copyrights attached to IP need also to be clear in terms of ownership.
* One would also need to make sure all repos are properly licensed, under acceptable T&Cs / license.


# Resources

* Making your GitHub project public is not the same as licensing your project. Public projects are covered by GitHub’s Terms of Service, which allows others to view and fork your project, but your work otherwise comes with no permissions. If you want others to use, distribute, modify, or contribute back to your project, you need to include an open source license. For example, someone cannot legally use any part of your GitHub project in their code, even if it’s public, unless you explicitly give them the right to do so.

* "__What does my company’s legal team need to know?__ If you’re releasing an open source project as a company employee, first, your legal team should know that you’re open sourcing a project. (Section 8 [there](https://opensource.guide/legal/))
